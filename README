README for merlin-dashboard
===========================
This dashboard for Nagios using the Merlin backend was originally made by Morten Bekkelund <bekkelund@gmail.com> and made available at http://dingleberry.me/2010/04/our-new-dashboard/ and later at https://github.com/mortis1337/nagios-dashboard where several people forked it.

Meanwhile, I and a number of other customers had been hacking on it in private, fixing bugs and adding features, but not publishing the additions.

This is, finally, a fork of Morten's code with the additional patches. I aim to continue maintaining this, possibly adding patches from other people's forks.

License
=======
Morten's code says "GPL" but unspecified version. I'm assuming GPLv2.

Requirements
============
* Nagios, a version that works with the Merlin version you're running
* Merlin, pretty much any version > 1.0.0 should work fine
* Webserver with PHP5 and MySQL support

Installation
============
Put the files in a directory on your webserver.

Ideally, symlink nagios.php to index.php to save typing.

Edit merlin.php and change the server, username and password to fit your environment.
