README for merlin-dashboard
===========================
This dashboard for Nagios using the Merlin backend was originally made by Morten Bekkelund <bekkelund@gmail.com> and made available at http://dingleberry.me/2010/04/our-new-dashboard/ and later at https://github.com/mortis1337/nagios-dashboard where several people forked it.

Meanwhile, I and a number of other people had been hacking on it in private, fixing bugs and adding features, but not publishing the additions.

This is, finally, a fork of Morten's code with the additional patches. I aim to continue maintaining this, possibly adding patches from other people's forks.

Patches from the following list of fine people and companies:

License
=======
Morten's code says "GPL" but unspecified version. I'm assuming GPLv2.

Requirements
============
* Webserver with PHP5 and MySQL support
* Nagios, a version that works with the Merlin version you're running
* Merlin, anything > 1.0.0 and < 2.0 **

** In Merlin 2.0, saving status data to the database is turned off by default. This will break the dashboard. I am currently implementing a livestatus backend for merlin-dashboard, but it will not be ready in time for release of Merlin 2.0. If you do not mind the performance penalty of writing status data to the database, you can turn it on again by adding "track_current = yes" and an import program to your merlin.conf.
 
Installation
============
Put the files in a directory on your webserver.

Ideally, symlink nagios.php to index.php to save typing.

Edit merlin.php and change the server, username and password to fit your environment.
